# Clustering Tagged Data
Author: [Srikanth K S (talegari)](https://github.com/talegari)
> -- Code for shiny to cluster tagged data -- based on [analyzing tagged data](https://github.com/talegari/analyzing-tagged-data)

----

* The web interface is deployed at [https://talegari.shinyapps.io/ctd_shinyapps](https://talegari.shinyapps.io/ctd_shinyapps)

* Its suggested to run this locally on your system as it saves the author some hours on the free account at [shinyapps](http://shinyapps.io). Instructions to run locally:
    * Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
    * Install the following packages: `dplyr`, `reshape2` , `ggplot2` , `RCurl` , `shiny` and their dependencies. For example: package `dplyr` can be installed by typing `install.packages('dplyr')`
    * Run the App in your default browser by typing `runGitHub('talegari/clustering-tagged-data')`
    
* In case of an issue, gmail the author at `sri.teach`.

**Update 1**: 'Weight'ed version implemented. Implementation details can be found in 'How does it work' section of the [web interface](https://talegari.shinyapps.io/ctd_shinyapps).
