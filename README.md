* The web interface is deployed at [https://talegari.shinyapps.io/ctd_shinyapps](https://talegari.shinyapps.io/ctd_shinyapps)

* Its suggested to run this locally on your system as it saves the author some hours on the free account at [shinyapps](http://shinyapps.io). Instructions to run locally:
    * Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
    * Install the following packages: `dplyr`, `reshape2` , `ggplot2` , `RCurl` , `shiny` and their dependencies. For example: package `dplyr` can be installed by typing the folowing line in your R command line: `install.packages('dplyr')`
    * Run the App by typing `runGitHub('talegari/clustering-tagged-data')` on your R command line. This opens the App in your default browser.
    
* In case of an issue, write to the gmail the author at `sri.teach`.
